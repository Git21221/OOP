        <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
      </strong>
    </center>
    <strong>1) What is OOP? Full explanation.</strong> <br />
    OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming language, the main purpose of OOP
    is to deal with real world entities using programming language. <br />
    <strong>OOP features: </strong>
    <ol type="0">
      <li>Class</li>
      <li>Object</li>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
      <li>Polymorphism</li>
      <li>Encapsulation</li>
      <li>Abstraction</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>What is Class?</strong> <br />
    Class is a collection of objects and it doesn't take any memory. Class is
    also called as blueprint / logical entity. <br />
    <strong>What is Object?</strong> <br />
    Object is an instance of class that executes the class. Once the object is
    created, it takes up space like other variable in memory. <br />
  </body>
  <strong>What is Constructor? full explanation.</strong>
  <br />
  Constructor is a speacial type of method whose name is same as class name.
  <strong>N.B: </strong>
  <ol type="7">
    <li>The main purpose of constructor is initilize the object.</li>
    <li>Every java class has a constructor.</li>
    <li>
      A constructor is autometically called at the time of object creation.
    </li>
    <li>A constructor doesn't have any return type including void.</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Types of Constructor: </strong>
  <ol>
    <li>private</li>
    <li>default</li>
    <li>Parameterized</li>
    <li>Copy</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>What is Default Constructor?</strong>
  <br />
  A Constructor which does not have any parameter is called default constructor.
  <pre>
class A{
    A(){

    }
  }
</pre
  >
  <strong>What is Parameterized Constructor?</strong>
  <br />
  A Constructor through which we can pass one or more parameter is called
  parameterized constructor.
  <pre>
class A{
    A(int x, int y){

    }
  }
</pre
  >
  <strong>What is Copy Constructor?</strong>
  <br />
  Whenever we pass object referance to the constructor then it is called copy
  constructor.
  <pre>
class A{
    A(A ref){

    }
  }
</pre
  >
  <strong>What is Private Constructor?</strong>
  <br />
  In java, it is possible to write a constructor as a private but according to
  rule we can't access private members outside of a class.
  <pre>
class A{
    private A(){

    }
  }
</pre
  >
  <strong>Constructor Overloading:- </strong>
  <br />
  When we have same constructor name and different parameter then it is called
  constructor overloading.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>
    First static block -> instance block -> constructor -> method is called.
  </h3>
  <br />
  <strong>Static Block? With syntax & example.</strong>
  <br />
  Static block is such kind of block in java which gets executed at the time of
  loading the .class file into JVM memory.

  <pre>
  class A{
    A(){
      //constructor block
    }
    {
      //instance block
    }
    static{
      //static block
    }
  }
</pre
  >
  <strong>What is a instance block?</strong>
  <br />
  instance block is similar to method which has no more, it can be written
  inside a class only but not inside a method.
  <br />
  <strong>N.B:</strong>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>It always executed before the constructor.</li>
    <li>We can use variable only inside the instance block not method.</li>
    <li>
      We write time consuming code inside a instance block like - JDBC
      connectivity.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <pre>
  class A{
    {
      //code
    }
  }
</pre
  >
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>No.</th>
      <th>Instance</th>
      <th>Static</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>It deals with object.</td>
      <td>It deals with class.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Exexuted at the time of object creation.</td>
      <td>Executed at the time of loading .class file in JVM.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Not any keyword required.</td>
      <td>static keyword required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>
        Static and non-static variable can be accessed inside instance block.
      </td>
      <td>Only static variable can be accessed inside static block.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h2><center>Inheritance</center></h2>
  <strong>What is inheritance? Full explanation.</strong>
  <br />
  When we construct a new class from existing class in such a way that the new
  class access all the features & properties of existing class is called
  inheritance.
  <br />
  <strong>N.B:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>In, java extends keyword is used to perform inheritance.</li>
    <li>It provides code reusability.</li>
    <li>We can't access private members of class through inheritance.</li>
    <li>
      A subclass contains all the features of super class so, we should create
      the object of subclass.
    </li>
    <li>Method overriding only possible through inheritance.</li>
  </ol>
  <pre>
  class A{
    //super class
  }
  class B extends A{
    //subclass
  }
</pre
  >
  <strong>Types of inheritance:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Single Inheritance</li>
    <li>Multilevel inheritance</li>
    <li>Multiple inheritance</li>
    <li>Hierarchial inheritance</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>What is super keyword?</strong>
  <br />
  Super keyword refers to the objects of super class, it is used when we want to
  call the super class variable, method & constructor thorugh subclass.
  <br />
  <strong>N.B:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Whenever the super class & subclass variable and method name both are same
      then it can be used only.
    </li>
    <li>
      To avoid the confusion between super and subclass variable and method.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <pre>
    class A{
      int a = 10;
    }
    class B extends A{
      super();
      int a = 20;
      void show(){
        System.out.print(a);
        System.out.print(super.a);
      }
    }
    class Test{
      public static void main(String[] args){
        B r = new B();
        r.show();
      }
    }
  </pre>
  <strong>What is "this" keyword?</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>
      "this" keyword refers to the current object inside a method or
      constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whenever the name of instance and local variable are same the our runtime
      environment JVM gets consfused.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is also used When we want to call the default constructor of it's own
      class.
    </li>
    <li>It also call parameterized constructor of its own class</li>
  </ol>
  <pre>
    class A{
      int a; //instance
      A(int a){
        this.a = a;
      }
    }
  </pre>
  <center><h2>Polymorphism</h2></center>
  <br />
  Polymorphism is a geek word that means "same object having different
  behaviour".
  <br />
  <strong>Types of Polymorphism: </strong>
  <br />
  i) Compiletime Polymorphism (Early binding)
  <br />
  ii) Runtime Polymorphism (Late binding)
  <br />
  <strong>Compile Time Polymorphism</strong>
  <br />
  A Polymorphism which exists at the time of compilation is called Compile Time
  Polymorphism or early binding or static binding.
  <br />
  Example: Method overloading.
  <br />
  Whenever a class contain more than one method with same name and different
  types of parameter called method overloading.
  <br />
  <strong>Runtime Polymorphism</strong>
  <br />
  A Polymorphism which exists at the time of execution of program is called
  runtime Polymorphism.
  <br />
  <b>Example:</b>
  Method overriding
  <br />
  Whenever we write method in super and subclass in such a way that name and
  parameter must be same then its a method overriding.
  <br />
  <strong
    ><center><h2>Encapsulation</h2></center></strong
  ><br />
  Encapsulation is a mechanism through which we can wrap the data and method in
  a single unit.
  <br />
  <strong>N.B:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Declare the class variable as private.</li>
    <li>Declare the class methods as a public.</li>
  </ol>
  <strong
    ><h2><center>Abstraction</center></h2></strong
  >
  <br />
  Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation from the user, only the
  highlighted set of services provided to the user.
  <strong>Advantage:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Enhancement</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Two type of implementation of abstraction</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Abstract class</li>
    <li>Interface</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>What is abstract class?</strong>
  <br />
  A class which contains the abstract keyword in its declaration is called
  abstarct class.
  <br />
  <strong>N.B:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>We can't create object for abstract class.</li>
    <li>It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.</li>
    <li>
      To use an abstract class you have to inherit it from another subclass.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a class contains partial implementation then we should declare a class
      as abstarct.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>What is abstract method?</strong>
  <br />
  A method which contains abstract modifier at the time of declaration is called
  abstract method.
  <br />
  <strong>N.B:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>It can only be used in abstract class.</li>
    <li>It doesn't contain any body "{}" and always ends with ";".</li>
    <li>
      Abstract method must be overriden in subclasses otherwise it will be also
      become a abstarct class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whenever the action is common but implementations are different then we
      should use abstract method.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>What is Interface?</strong>
  <br />
  Interface is just like a class, which contains only abstract method. To
  achieve interface java provides a keyword called 'implements'.
  <br />
  <strong>N.B:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>interface methods are default public & asbtract.</li>
    <li>Interface variable are by default public + static + final</li>
    <li>interface method must be overriden inside the implementing class.</li>
    <li>Interface nothing but deals between client & developer</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Multiple inheritance using interface?</strong>
  <br />
  we can achieve multiple inheritace through interfaces because interface
  contains only abstract method, which implementation is provided by the
  subclasses.
  <br />
  <strong>What is co-varient return type?</strong>
  <br />
  Before this concept generally we can't change the return type of iverriden
  method but new concept introduced in java called co-varient where we can
  change the return type of overriden method.
  <br />
  <strong>What is var-arg method?</strong>
  <br />
  var-arg is known as variable number of argument methods and it is new
  introduced in JDk 1.5. By usong this concept we can pass any no. of parameters
  including zero parameter to the calling.
  <br />
  <pre>
    void add (int ... a){}
  </pre>
  <strong>What is Exception?</strong>
  <br />
  An exception is unexpected / unwanted / abnormal situation that occur in
  runtime.
  <br />

    alt=""
    style="width: 40%"
  />
  <strong>What is checked exception?</strong>
  <br />
  The exxception which are checked by compiler for smooth execution of program
  of runtime.
  <br />
  <strong>What is unchecked exception?</strong>
  <br />
  The exxception which are not checked by compiler ans it directly taken care by
  JVM.
  <br />
  <strong>What is finalize method?</strong>
  <br />
  Finalize is a method which is available in object super class. The purpose of
  finalize method is to release the resources allocated by unused object, before
  removing unused object by garbage collector.
  <br />
  <strong>What is throw keyword?</strong>
  Throw keyword to is used to show userdefind exception externally.
  <br />
  <strong>What is throws keyword?</strong>
  <br />
  Throws keyword is used when we doesn't want to handle the exception and try to
  send the exception to the JVM or other method.
  <strong>User defined exception</strong>
  <br />
  <pre>
    class InvalidVoteException extends Exception{
      InvalidVoteException(String msg){
        System.out.println(msg);
      }
    }
    class test{
      public static void main(String[] args){
        try{
          vote(12);
        }
        catch(Exception e){
          System.out.println(e)
        }
      }
      public static void vote(int age) throws InvalidVoteException{
        if(age < 18) throw new InvalidVoteException("You not too low");
        else System.out.println("You can vote");
      }
    }
  </pre>
  <strong>What is exception propagation?</strong>
  <br />
  It is a technique to handle the exception in caller method.
  <br />
  <pre>
  main(){
    m1();
  }
  m1(){
    m2();
  }
  m2(){
    1/0;
  }
</pre
  >
  <strong>What is file handling?</strong
  ><br />
  File handling defines how we can read and write data on a file. Java IO
  package contains all the classes through which we can perform all input and
  output operations in the file.
  <strong>Stream:</strong>
  <br />
  Stream is a sequence of data. On the basis of java.io package all the classes
  divided into two stream.
  <br />
  Stream are two types: i) Byte, ii) Character.
  <strong>File handling method: </strong>
  <ol>
    <li>canRead</li>
    <li>canWrite</li>
    <li>createNewFile</li>
    <li>Delete</li>
    <li>Exists</li>
    <li>Length</li>
    <li>getName</li>
    <li>getAbsolutePath</li>
    <li>Mkdir</li>
    <li>List</li>
    <li>read</li>
    <li>write</li>
    <li>renameTo</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>File handling class:</strong>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>File</li>
    <li>FileReader</li>
    <li>FileWriter</li>
    <li>FileInputStream</li>
    <li>FileOutputStream</li>
    <li>BufferedInputStream</li>
    <li>BufferedOutputStream</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>operations on file</strong>CRUD
  <strong>Multithreading:</strong> <br>
  Multithreading is a process to execute multiple threads at the same time without dependency of other threads called Multithreading. <br>
  <strong>What is thread?</strong> <br>
  thread is a pre-defined class which is available in ajva.lang package.
  Thread is a basic unit of CPU and it is well known for independent execution. <br>
  <strong>How to create thread?</strong> <br>
  i) By extending thread class.
  ii) by implementing runnable interface.
  <pre>
    class A extends Thread{
      @override
      run(){

      }
    }
    class B{
      psvm(){
        A t = new A();
        t.start();
      }
    }
  </pre>
  <pre>
    class A implements Runnable{
      run(){

      }
    }
    class B{
      psvm(){
        A r = new A();
        Thread t = new Thread(r);
        t.start() 
      }
    }
  </pre>
  <strong>What is thread scheduler?</strong> <br>
  Thread scheduler is the part of JVM which executes multiple threads on a single processor randomly. <br>
  <strong>What is thread life cycle?</strong> <br>
  As we know a thread is well known for independent execution. During the life cycle a thread can move from different state.
  i) New state (Born)
  ii) Runnable state (Ready)
  iii) Running state (Execution)
  iv) Waiting state (Blocked)
  v) Dead state (Exit)
